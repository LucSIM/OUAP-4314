The project needs Docker to be executed, the command line that deploys the
project is: docker-compose

The project is located in the folder called Evaluation.
You can check the reference guide and user guide inside the folder project
for more information.

In the Evaluation folder, there are some of the bonus exercises I did:
	-Introduction_Exercice1.py
	-Introduction_Exercice2.py
	-Introduction_Exercice3.py
	-Mongo_Exercice3.py
They are scripts that use python 3.

Introduction_Exercice3.py and Mongo_Exercice3.py are not finished and they 
might not be executable.
